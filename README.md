## PointNet++ 
-------------------------18 March 2022---------------------------------  
Weights_trained_on_ShapeNet shows the [PointNet++](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2) network we used to gain pretrained models.   
The checkpoint floder contains the weights we trained on [ShapeNet](https://shapenet.org/) Dataset.   
Please refer the [PointNet++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413) article for more details.

## mmdection3D
### I found [mmdetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d) contain some 3D compoment segmentation backbone, but the dataset they used are ScanNet, SUNRGB-D, Waymo, nuScenes, Lyft, and KITTI.

## 3D Part Segmentation on ShapeNet
I found a leadboard : [3D Part Segmentation](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/3d-part-segmentation-on-shapenet-part) on ShapeNet,


### The code is constantly being updated
